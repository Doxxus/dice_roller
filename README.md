# Simple Dice Roller
 
Created By: Lachlan Campbell

# Installation Instructions:

> Make sure you are using Python 3.5 or higher, I haven't tested whether or not this will work with earlier versions, so better to be safe than sorry. 

> Make sure you have PySimpleGUI installed using the command 'pip install pysimplegui' or 'pip3 install pysimplegui' as this relies on it.

> Move roller.py and simple_roller.py into the desired folder (or keep them in the code folder if you wish).

> Navigate to the folder the code files are in a console window and then type 'python simple_roller.py' or 'python3 simple_roller.py'

> Enjoy rolling some dice.

The program will generate a text file called 'roll.txt' with the last roll (or rolls) inside of it (for OBS useage).
